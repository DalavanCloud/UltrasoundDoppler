@W: MT531 :"e:\backup download\usd\beamscanner\clk_gen.v":41:0:41:5|Found signal identified as System clock which controls 752 sequential elements including I212.Freq2.  Using this clock, which has no specified timing constraint, can prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and can adversely impact design performance. 
@W: MT529 :"e:\backup download\usd\beamscanner\sr24bit.v":41:0:41:5|Found inferred clock BeamScanner|SRCLK which controls 24 sequential elements including SPI_Interface.Q[0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance. 
@W: MT529 :"e:\backup download\usd\beamscanner\fifo24bit.v":58:0:58:5|Found inferred clock BeamScanner|RD_ctrlFF_inferred_clock which controls 5 sequential elements including Ctrl_Fifo.RD_PTR[4:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
