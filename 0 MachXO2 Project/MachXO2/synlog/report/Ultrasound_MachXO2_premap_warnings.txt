@W: FX474 |User-specified initial value defined for some sequential elements which can prevent optimum synthesis results from being achieved. 
@W: MT462 :"d:\workspace\ultrasounddoppler\0 machxo2 project\modules\corelayer.v":68:12:68:86|Net core.RX_CLK appears to be an unidentified clock source. Assuming default frequency. 
@W: MT529 :"d:\workspace\ultrasounddoppler\0 machxo2 project\modules\communicationlayer.v":35:0:35:5|Found inferred clock UltrasoundDopplerTop|CLK_EXT which controls 90 sequential elements including com.mem_burst_cnt[7:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance. 
@W: MT529 :"d:\workspace\ultrasounddoppler\0 machxo2 project\modules\spi_slave.v":36:0:36:5|Found inferred clock UltrasoundDopplerTop|spi_clk which controls 79 sequential elements including com.mode3out.counter[15:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
